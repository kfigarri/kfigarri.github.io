abstract: 'As a key feature for teachers’ skills development in the Merdeka Mengajar
  Platform, Pelatihan Mandiri faced scaling challenges due to the exponential growth
  of users and submitted reporting documents (named: Aksi Nyata). These documents
  require validation for users to receive formal certificates from the Ministry of
  Education. Manual checking by human validators proved unsustainable with the rapid
  increase in document submissions. To overcome with the challenges, an automated
  validation system was initiated. This system employs a two-stage process as follows.
  The first stage utilizes distinct components of the Aksi Nyata submissions to filter
  out plagiarized documents using the Levenshtein distance method and addresses common
  errors, such as missing reflections and image documentation, through a rule-based
  approach. In the second stage, the entire content of Aksi Nyata submissions is preprocessed
  through tokenization, stopword removal, and word embeddings. State-of-the-art machine
  learning models were then trained on manually validated data sets, selecting those
  with the highest coverage and lowest error rates. To date, the model has processed
  up to 80% of document submissions per month with a false positive rate of 2%. This
  system has also resulted in speeding up the validation process time by 76%, henceforth
  accelerating the feedback process for users.'

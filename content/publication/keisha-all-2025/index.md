abstract: 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucinations by grounding
  large language model outputs in cited sources, a capability that is especially critical
  in the legal domain. We present an end-to-end RAG pipeline that revisits and extends
  the LegalBenchRAG baseline with three targeted enhancements: (i) a context-aware
  query translator that disentangles document references from natural-language questions
  and adapts retrieval depth and response style based on expertise and specificity,
  (ii) open-source retrieval strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve
  substantial performance gains (improving Recall@K by 30-95% and Precision@K by $sim$2.5$times$
  for $Ktextgreater4$) while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation
  and generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to
  assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs. Our
  results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival or outperform
  proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom legal-grounded prompt
  consistently produces more faithful and contextually relevant answers than baseline
  prompting. Taken together, these contributions demonstrate the potential of task-aware,
  component-level tuning to deliver legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective
  RAG systems for legal research assistance.'

 abstract = {Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucinations by grounding large language model outputs in cited sources, a capability that is especially critical in the legal domain. We present an end-to-end RAG pipeline that revisits and extends the LegalBenchRAG baseline with three targeted enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance gains (improving Recall@K by 30-95\% and Precision@K by \$\sim\$2.5\$\times\$ for \$K\textgreater4\$) while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs. Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival or outperform proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal research assistance.},

**_Extreme weather is inevitable, but crop failure doesn’t have to be._**

## 🏆 Regional Recognition at the United Nations Datathon 2023

As Team **4SKA1**, we were honored to be selected as **[The Best Team in the Asian Region](https://unstats.un.org/bigdata/events/2023/un-datathon/winners.cshtml)** at the **United Nations Datathon 2023**. This global competition challenged participants to develop innovative data-driven applications combining geospatial and statistical data to advance the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.


## 🚜 The Problem: Climate Uncertainty Meets Agriculture

Farmers in West Java, one of Indonesia’s major rice-producing regions, are increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events, such as droughts, floods, and irregular rainfall. These threats can severely disrupt food supply and jeopardize farmers’ livelihoods.

Despite the urgency, many farmers lack access to early and localized information to prepare for such risks.

## 💡 The Solution: KaPaN

We proposed **KaPaN** (Kalender Padi Nusantara - _Nusantara Rice Calendar_), a prototype website that serves as an **early warning system for extreme weather**, tailored specifically for local farmers.

KaPaN empowers users to:
- **Track** when and how long extreme weather is forecasted in their area  
- **Visualize** the spatial extent of weather anomalies  
- **Report and share** real-time ground-level information with fellow farmers

The name “KaPaN” (Indonesian for “When?”) reflects our goal to answer farmers' biggest question when facing uncertainty.

## 🔬 The Method: Extreme Value Analysis

We used **Extreme Value Analysis (EVA)** (specifically the **Block Maxima method**) to analyze rare and high-impact events such as intense rainfall and drought.

With the help of Python and the `pyextremes` library, we simulated thresholds for extreme conditions and provided early warnings that farmers can act on.

## 🌐 Accessible, Actionable, and Community-Driven

The KaPaN platform is designed to be:
- **User-friendly**: intuitive dashboard tailored for farmers  
- **Insightful**: visualizations help interpret trends over time and across regions  
- **Collaborative**: enables farmers to contribute ground-level observations

	abstract = {As a key feature for teachers’ skills development in the Merdeka Mengajar Platform, Pelatihan Mandiri faced scaling challenges due to the exponential growth of users and submitted reporting documents (named: Aksi Nyata). These documents require validation for users to receive formal certificates from the Ministry of Education. Manual checking by human validators proved unsustainable with the rapid increase in document submissions. To overcome with the challenges, an automated validation system was initiated. This system employs a two-stage process as follows. The first stage utilizes distinct components of the Aksi Nyata submissions to filter out plagiarized documents using the Levenshtein distance method and addresses common errors, such as missing reflections and image documentation, through a rule-based approach. In the second stage, the entire content of Aksi Nyata submissions is preprocessed through tokenization, stopword removal, and word embeddings. State-of-the-art machine learning models were then trained on manually validated data sets, selecting those with the highest coverage and lowest error rates. To date, the model has processed up to 80\% of document submissions per month with a false positive rate of 2\%. This system has also resulted in speeding up the validation process time by 76\%, henceforth accelerating the feedback process for users.},

	abstract = {Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucinations by grounding large language model outputs in cited sources, a capability that is especially critical in the legal domain. We present an end-to-end RAG pipeline that revisits and extends the LegalBenchRAG baseline with three targeted enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance gains (improving Recall@K by 30-95{\textbackslash}\% and Precision@K by \${\textbackslash}sim\$2.5\${\textbackslash}times\$ for \$K{\textgreater}4\$) while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs. Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival or outperform proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal research assistance.},
